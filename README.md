# Flow Builder

This project is an interactive Flow Builder web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). It allows users to visually create, edit, and manage message flows using a drag-and-drop interface. The builder is designed for scenarios such as chatbot design, automated messaging workflows, or any process that benefits from a node-based visual editor.
